### METADATA

It contains 2 datasets: 

"NE_data.csv" contains data on Relative yield total (RYT), Net biodiversity effect (NE), Complementarity effect (CE) and Selection effect (SE) for all the polycultures in every block at Days 0, 20, 40 and 60.

"Biom_data.csv" contains data on species biomass per Block/Mixture/Days. 
(Individual_mass) corresponds to the mass mean of 10 individuals in mg.
(Mean_LA) refers to the mean of leaf area per 10 individuals in mm^2.
(Mean_SLA) is the mean Specific leaf area computed from 10 individuals in mm^2/mg.
(Initial_relbiomass) refers to the initial biomass of the species included in the mixture at Day 0.
(Final_relbiomass) refers to the final biomass of the species included in the mixture at Day 60.
